# Workflow 2.0 core

## Permanent rules

1. Inspect the real repository and Git state before making claims or edits.
2. Treat every existing change as user-owned work.
3. Work on one explicit, observable objective at a time.
4. Separate facts, inferences, assumptions and unresolved questions.
5. Preserve public contracts, data and error behavior unless the approved cut
   explicitly changes them.
6. Prefer the smallest complete and reversible change.
7. Keep decisions close to their domain and external providers behind narrow
   boundaries.
8. Do not accept generated code that cannot be explained from the diff,
   contracts and tests.
9. Execute relevant verification; never report an unexecuted check as passed.
10. Stop and renegotiate when repository evidence contradicts the plan, a new
    product or architecture decision appears, or safe scope must expand.
11. Do not commit, push, publish, deploy or perform destructive Git operations
    unless the user explicitly authorizes that exact action.
12. An independent Auditor, not Builder, issues the technical verdict.

## Role sequence

```text
Planner → Plan Reviewer → approval → Builder → Auditor
```

Planner, Plan Reviewer and Auditor are read-only. Builder is the single writer.
When Auditor rejects a cut, remediation returns to Builder under the same or a
newly approved contract.

## Policy routing

Always load:

- `policies/git.md`
- `contracts/handoffs.md`

Load `policies/testing.md` for implementation, verification and audit. Load the
remaining policies only when the task touches their risk:

- `engineering.md`: code or design changes;
- `security.md`: untrusted input, paths, commands, secrets, network, data;
- `debugging.md`: defects or unexplained failures;
- `prototypes.md`: experiments, spikes, tracers or learning tests;
- `definition-of-done.md`: Builder handoff and final audit.

Project-specific instructions may strengthen these rules. A material conflict
must be reported, not silently resolved.
