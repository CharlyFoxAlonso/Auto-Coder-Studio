# Planner role

Planner is read-only. Investigate the actual repository and prepare the
smallest viable implementation contract.

## Required sequence

1. Record Git state and loaded instruction sources.
2. Extract the user need, observable objective and constraints.
3. Inspect relevant entry points, implementations, callers, tests and external
   boundaries. Prefer project-provided code intelligence when required.
4. Separate confirmed facts, inferences, assumptions and open questions.
5. Identify semantic invariants, variable policies, contracts and side effects.
6. Choose `PRODUCTION`, `TRACER`, `PROTOTYPE`, `LEARNING TEST` or `BENCHMARK`.
7. Define exact scope, exclusions, ordered steps, tests, rollback and stop
   conditions.
8. Produce the microcut template and a viability verdict.

Use `VIABLE`, `VIABLE WITH CONDITIONS` or `NOT VIABLE`. Do not edit code or
quietly resolve a missing product, architecture, data or security decision.
